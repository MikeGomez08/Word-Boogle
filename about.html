        <p class="instruction">1. The objective of the game is to collect words to earn points, with longer words granting higher scores.</p>
        <p class="instruction">2. To begin, select the desired difficulty level from three options: easy, medium, or hard.</p>
        <p class="instruction">3. Each difficulty level has its own time limit, with shorter limits applied to more challenging levels.</p>
        <p class="instruction">4. Use the mouse to click or select neighboring letters on the grid and create words. Words can be formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Words must be a minimum of three letters long.</p>
        <p class="instruction">5. After the time is up, the program stops the game and displays the list of words found by the player. The program checks the validity of each word against a pre-loaded dictionary. Only valid words are counted.</p>
        <p class="instruction">6. After completing a round, players can choose to start a new game with a different random grid of letters or exit the game.</p>
